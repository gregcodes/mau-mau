There are also a lot of possibly very different answers to the questions posed by Meyer and they manifest in very different approaches to the implementation of OO in different programming languages.\n\n\nHigh level view\n\u00b6\n\n\nOne koan in the \nZen of Python\n says: \"If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea\". Let's put this to the test and explain the implementation of our Mau Mau program by simply describing the conditions and rules of the game using a rough approximation of the programs' terminology and see if the objects and their interactions make the implementation look obvious. Objects used in the program are marked \nlike this\n, functions that describe (inter)actions are marked like \nthis\n). The game can also be described in two phases, we could call \"setup\" and \"play\". The image shows all the important elements of the simulation.\n\n\n\n\nsetup:\n The \nplayers\n are \ninvited\n to a \ngame\n at the \ntable\n. A \ndeck\n of \ncards\n is \nshuffled\n. The same amount of cards is \ndealt\n to the \nplayers\n to form their \nhand\n. One \ncard\n - the \nupcard\n - is \ndrawn\n from the \nstock\n and placed face up on the \ntable\n. The remaining cards are \npiled\n face down on the \ntable\n and form the \nstock\n. Now all is in place to \nplay\n the \ngame\n. \n\n\nplay:\n The \nplayers\n play in \nturns\n. They choose a\ncard\n that is \nplayable\n with the \nupcard\n according to the rules (same \nsuit\n or same \nvalue\n and \nspecial rules\n and place it on the \ntable\n. The played \ncard\n ist the new  \nupcard\n and the old \nupcard\n is now part of the \nwaste\n. Now the next \nplayer\n is up. If a player can't find a \ncard\n to play, they have to draw one from the \nstock\n and the next \nplayer\n is up. If the \nstock\n \nis empty\n, the \nwaste\n \ncards\n will be \nshuffled\n to form the new \nstock\n. The game is over and the \nwinner\n is found as soon as one \nplayer\n plays the last card of their \nhand\n.\n\n\nEasy enough to explain. This description of the rules and the gameplay can double already as a high level explanation of the implementation. It can also be read as an abstract story about a game, where the concrete story would be the description of an actual game. The program code can be viewed as story shape or abstract plot, with different executions of it as concrete stories. If you have no idea what I mean just watch \nKurt Vonneguts short talk about the shape of stories\n and transfer your insights into thinking about abstract program code and its concrete execution :)\n\n\nImplementation\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe modelling problem we have here is a good fit to create your own data structures (which classes are), so we will model the game flow using \ncustom Python classes\n that interact in the way described above.\n\n\nThe code is aiming to be readable and to demonstrate a whole range of concepts and \npythonic\n ways to write software. It is not a toy example, but the nasty details that usually screw with our nice and simple design and make the code grow tentacles and other cruft is not (yet) part of the code, so it can still be read like a nice little completely non-linear story (hopefully). It came into live in a non-linear fashion and should also be read that way.",

The image shows all the important elements of the simulation.   setup:  The  players  are  invited  to a  game  at the  table . A  deck  of  cards  is  shuffled . The same amount of cards is  dealt  to the  players  to form their  hand . One  card  - the  upcard  - is  drawn  from the  stock  and placed face up on the  table . The remaining cards are  piled  face down on the  table  and form the  stock . Now all is in place to  play  the  game .   play:  The  players  play in  turns . They choose a card  that is  playable  with the  upcard  according to the rules (same  suit  or same  value  and  special rules  and place it on the  table . The played  card  ist the new   upcard  and the old  upcard  is now part of the  waste . Now the next  player  is up. If a player can't find a  card  to play, they have to draw one from the  stock  and the next  player  is up. If the  stock   is empty , the  waste   cards  will be  shuffled  to form the new  stock . The game is over and the  winner  is found as soon as one  player  plays the last card of their  hand .  Easy enough to explain. This description of the rules and the gameplay can double already as a high level explanation of the implementation. It can also be read as an abstract story about a game, where the concrete story would be the description of an actual game. The program code can be viewed as story shape or abstract plot, with different executions of it as concrete stories. If you have no idea what I mean just watch  Kurt Vonneguts short talk about the shape of stories  and transfer your insights into thinking about abstract program code and its concrete execution :)",
